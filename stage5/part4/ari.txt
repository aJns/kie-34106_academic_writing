Dear Ari,

You've done a good job on identifying the different sentences and their
functions. I also think it's clever that you've taken a small part of the text
for analysis; This way you can create a more in-depth text review, and it's
not as mind numbingly boring to read for me.

Best Regards,
Jonas Nikula
