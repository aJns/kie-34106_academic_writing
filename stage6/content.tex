My stated goals at the beginning of the course were to get better at planning
my writing and doing it in stages. Unfortunately, at least in this course, I've
not improved a lot. I'd like to blame my other studies for taking up so much
time, but I am at fault too for not planning my time better. I've usually
written my text only on the deadline date, and sometimes I've cut it
uncomfortably close. So scheduling is something I definitely still have to work
on, probably something like allocating a certain day for writing.

I have however learned something else; Understanding scientific texts better
and reading them more efficiently. Especially the ``3 passes'' method has been
very useful.

The next stage of my learning will be the course's stage 7, where we write a
longer text. This time scheduling and planning is crucial, so I hope I can
muster some effort to plan properly. I am planning to allocate some days per
week to fully focus on writing, so that I can work the text more gradually,
which should result in less stress for me and a better text.
