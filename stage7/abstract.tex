The internet of things (IoT) aims to connect the devices and things we use in
our daily lives. IoT and the many technologies that enable it have many
potential applications in many different domains. This literature review has
the purpose of presenting an overview of the present and potential applications
of IoT in the health care field based primarily on the articles~\cite{Bui2011}
and~\cite{Islam2015}. In the health care field IoT can enable a higher quality
of care with smaller costs. It can also increase access to health care in rural
areas and help aging and disabled patients live more independent lives.
However, IoT systems also have unique challenges that need to be taken into
consideration when designing them.
