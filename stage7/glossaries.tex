\newglossaryentry{wearable}
{
  name=Wearables,
    description={
      are electronic devices which are designed to be worn by users. Includes smart
        watches, activity trackers etc. They can be thought of IoT devices
        depending on the amount of user interaction, ie. smart watches aren't
        necessarily IoT devices because their main use is to interact with the
        user, but activity trackers mostly exist to monitor the user and their
        behaviour without much interaction, so they could be classified as IoT
        devices.
