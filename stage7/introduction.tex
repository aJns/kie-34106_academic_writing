\section{Introduction}
This is a literature review of the articles~\cite{Bui2011}
and~\cite{Islam2015}. The purpose of this literature review is to present an
overview of the present and potential applications of IoT (\gls{iot}) in the
health care field based primarily on the aforementioned articles.

In this paper I first aim to define IoT and explore the technologies that
enable it section~\ref{sec:iot}. Then I lay out the challenges in health care
that IoT technologies can help solve in section~\ref{sec:health}. After that I
look at how IoT can tackle those challenges in section~\ref{sec:iot-health}.
Finally I present my conclusions in section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
